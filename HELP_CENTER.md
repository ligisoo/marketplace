## For Buyers

### How do I buy a tip?
1.  Browse the **Marketplace** to see available tips.
2.  Visit the **Leaderboard** to see top-performing tipsters.
3.  When you find a tip you like, click the "Buy" button.
4.  You will be prompted to complete the payment using M-Pesa.
5.  Once the payment is successful, the tip details will be revealed to you.

### How do I know if a tipster is reliable?
We believe in transparency. Every tipster has a public profile with their historical performance, including win rate, total tips, and average odds. Our leaderboards are based on automatically verified match results, so you can trust the data.

### What happens after I buy a tip?
The tip is added to your "My Purchases" section. You can view the details there at any time. After the match is over, the result of the tip (Won, Lost, or Void) will be updated automatically.

### What if a tip is incorrect or the match is cancelled?
If a match is postponed or cancelled, the tip will be marked as "Void," and this will not negatively affect the tipster's win rate. If you believe there is an error with a tip or its result, you can raise a dispute.

## For Tipsters

### How do I become a tipster?
Any registered user can become a tipster. Simply navigate to the "Create Tip" page to post your first tip.

### How do I create a tip?
You can create a tip by filling out the form on the "Create Tip" page. You can either enter the match details manually or upload a screenshot of your betslip from a supported bookmaker. Our OCR technology will attempt to extract the details automatically.

### How do I get paid?
Your earnings from tip sales accumulate in your wallet. You can view your balance in your earnings dashboard. When you're ready to cash out, you can request a withdrawal, which will be processed to your registered M-Pesa number. Please note that the platform retains a small commission from each sale.

### How is my win rate calculated?
Your win rate is calculated based on the results of your "resulted" tips (tips for matches that have finished). We use a reliable sports data API to automatically fetch match results and determine if a tip was won or lost. This process is fully automated to ensure fairness and accuracy.
